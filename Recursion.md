Why is recursion a useful technique for solving a big problem?

- It divides a problem into smaller and smaller parts making it easier to solve

What are the limitations of using recursive solutions?

- Recursion can exceed memory limits. It can also be difficult to understand/read, so loops are often a better solution

What types of problems are more suited for simple loops than recursion?

- Problems with deep recursive depth

What is meant by “recursive depth?”

- How many times the function calls itself

What is a “stack overflow” (the concept, not the website)?

- When the call stack exceeds the available memory

Why is that relevant to a recursive problem?

- Because a complicated problem with large recursive depth will overwhelm the call stack and likely run out of memory and crash the program
